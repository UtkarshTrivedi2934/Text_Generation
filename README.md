# Text_Generation
Text generation using LSTM involves training a model on a corpus of text and then using the learned patterns to generate new, coherent sequences of text.

# Key features:

-> Sequential Learning: LSTMs are designed to handle sequential data, making them well-suited for tasks involving natural language processing and text generation.

-> Long-Term Dependencies: LSTMs address the challenge of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data, which is crucial for understanding context and coherence in language.

-> Memory Cells: LSTMs incorporate specialized memory cells that can selectively store and retrieve information over time, allowing them to capture and remember patterns across varying time scales.

-> Gating Mechanisms: Gate units within LSTMs control the flow of information through the network, enabling the model to decide which information to keep or discard. This helps in preventing the vanishing gradient problem during training.

-> Vanishing Gradient Mitigation: LSTMs mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, a common issue in training traditional RNNs on long sequences, by allowing information to be retained and passed through the network more effectively.
